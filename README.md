# SecureNotes
<<<<<<< HEAD
An iOS app for secure note-taking with AES-256-GCM encryption, biometric authentication, and secure deletion inspired by GPG.
=======

SecureNotes is an iOS app for secure note-taking, designed with privacy and security in mind. It uses **AES-256-GCM** for encryption, supports **biometric authentication** (Face ID/Touch ID), and securely deletes unencrypted notes, inspired by GPG's security principles.

## Features
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Notes are encrypted with AES-256-GCM.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Secure access using Face ID or Touch ID.
- **Secure Deletion**: Unencrypted notes are wiped to prevent data leaks.
- **Offline Support**: Notes are stored locally for maximum privacy.
- **GPG-Inspired**: Follows cryptographic best practices.

## Requirements
- iOS 16.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
